  <h1>Getting the Ball Rolling</h1>
  <p>Ruby Bayou is the user group for the Ruby developer community in New Orleans. We exist to promote and explore the use of Ruby as a programming language as well as engage with other technology and community groups in the New Orleans metro area.</p>
  <p>We’re just getting things started, so we need you. The choice of name has more meaning than the obvious reference to our location. This user group needs to be <strong><em>by you</em></strong>! This group will only come together if it is done <strong><em>by you</strong></em>. So, if you want it to happen, make it happen. Plug in, get active and let’s get this ball rolling...</p>
